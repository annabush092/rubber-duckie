#Rubber Duckie Piano
A piano you play organ-style with your computer keyboard.

Special thank you to Richard Schwartz's Tuning CD (https://www.amazon.com/Tuning-C-D-440-Richard-Schwartz/dp/B002COP51Q), which I used for sample notes to test this app. These mp3 files were only used for the educational purpose of building this app, and should NOT be copied for any other use. To buy the sound files, you can find the CD on Amazon at the link provided above.

Future sounds will hopefully include more than one octave and be a bit prettier to listen to. Not that the Tuning CD isn't beautiful in its own special way...


To play the Rubber Duckie Piano:

yarn install

yarn start

Now think of your keyboard like a stacked organ:

'z' - '/' go through the lowest white keys from C1 - E2

's' - ';' go through the lowest black keys from C#1 - Eb2 (Not every key is a note. This piano aims to imitate a real piano, so the black keys on the keyboard are placed approximately as close to where they should be in relation to the white keys below them.)

'q' - ']' go through the upper white keys from F2 - C4

'2' - '-' go through the upper black keys from F#2 - Bb3



Additional features to implement in the future:

get more/better sound clips, possibly from https://freesound.org/people/jobro/sounds/39185/

add users who can log in and record and save pieces... so add a backend

add a looping option with metronome
